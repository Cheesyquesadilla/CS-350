# CS-350
* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    - The PWM project was meant to get me use to implementing code that provided instructions for the microcontroller. The GPIO project wanted me to create a state machine along with utilizing a timer and interrupt to get the LED lights to blink in morse code.
* What did you do particularly well?
    - The only thing I feel that I did well was creating the state machines. I struggled alot when it came to utilizing it along with interrupts.
* Where could you improve?
    - I could improve in most areas. Before this I had never worked with C but my experience with C++ really helped me in this area. This was also my first time using the IDE along with my first time provinding intructions to a microcontroller. 
* What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    - I would like to get more experience utilizing the microcontroller with the IDE. I feel that starting with very simple projects and working my way up to more complex ones would be very beneficial.
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    - I feel that what I've learned from these experiences will better set me up for my next course in particular. I'm unsure about future coursework.
* How did you make this project maintainable, readable, adaptable?
    - These projects are readable thanks to the comments and naming variabls, functions, and state machine states in a way that told anyone what they were for. Other than that I wouldn't say the projects are maintainable or adaptable.
